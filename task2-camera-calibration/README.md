# Task 2: Camera Calibration

The aim of this project is to develop an application which creates an
undistorted image from a distorted image. This means that the distorted image
with its non-straight edges should be transformed into an undistorted image,
where the non-straight edges are straightened.

The written paper can be found under *docs*.
